The 96th Academy Awards ceremony, which was presented by the
Academy of Motion Picture Arts and
Sciences
(AMPAS), took place on March 10, 2024, at the Dolby
Theatre in
Hollywood, Los Angeles.[1] During
the gala, the AMPAS presented Academy
Awards (commonly referred to as Oscars) in
23 categories honoring films released in
2023. Comedian Jimmy
Kimmel hosted the show for the fourth time.
The nominations were announced on January 23, 2024.
Oppenheimer led with 13 nominations,
followed by Poor Things and Killers
of the Flower Moon with
11 and 10, respectively.[2][3][4] Oppenheimer won a leading seven
awards, including Best
Picture and Best
Director.[5] Other major
winners were Poor Things with four awards and The Zone of
Interest with two. The films
which won one award each include American
Fiction, Anatomy of a
Fall,
Barbie, The Boy and the
Heron, Godzilla Minus
One, The
Holdovers, The Last Repair

Sugar. The
telecast drew 19.5 million viewers in the United States, becoming the
most watched awards show since 2020.[6]
The Academy held its 14th annual Governors
Awards ceremony, hosted by John
Mulaney, at the Ray Dolby Ballroom at Ovation
Hollywood on January 9, 2024.[7] The
Academy Scientific and Technical
Awards were
presented by host Natasha Lyonne on
February 23, 2024, at the Academy Museum of Motion
Pictures in Los
Angeles.[8]
Winners and nominees
The nominees for the 96th Academy Awards were announced on January 23,
2024, by actors Zazie Beetz and Jack
Quaid at the Samuel Goldwyn
Theater in Beverly Hills.[9][10][11]
The winners were announced during the awards ceremony on March 10,
2024.[12]
The cultural phenomenon of "Barbenheimer"
received a total of twenty-one nominations (eight for
Barbie and thirteen for
Oppenheimer). The two films competed
against each other in six categories, including Best
Picture.[13][14][15]
Several notable nominees include Steven
Spielberg, who extended his record for the
most Best Picture nominations to thirteen;[16] Martin
Scorsese, who received his tenth nomination
for Best Director, and
became the oldest nominee in the category;[17] Thelma
Schoonmaker, who received her ninth
nomination for Best Film
Editing;[18] composer
John Williams, who received his 54th
nomination;[19][20] and Willie D. Burton,
who received his eighth nomination as a
below-the-line crew
member.[21][22][23]
Ten actors received their first Oscar nominations this year.[24] The
acting nominees included portrayals from three openly
LGBTQ+ actors: Colman
Domingo, Jodie
Foster, and Lily
Gladstone.[25][26] Gladstone also became the
first Native
American actress to
be nominated.[27][28] Scott George, who wrote
the music and lyrics to "Wahzhazhe (A Song for My People)", became the
first member of the Osage Nation to be
nominated for an Academy Award.[29]
This was the fifth consecutive year with at least one Best Picture
nominee directed by a woman: Greta Gerwig
with Barbie, Celine Song with Past
Lives, and Justine
Triet with Anatomy of a
Fall.[30][31] Triet also became the
eighth woman
nominated
for Best Director.[32][33] Overall, six couples received nominations
that they shared together in their respective categories.[34]
Billie Eilish and Finneas
O'Connell won Best Original
Song, becoming the
youngest two-time Oscar winners in history (22 and 26 years,
respectively), having previously won the award in
2022.[35] Killers of the Flower
Moon became Scorsese's
third film to be nominated in ten or more categories and not win a
single award, after Gangs of New York
and The Irishman.[36] The Zone of
Interest became the first
British film to win the International
Feature
category.[37]
Godzilla Minus One became the first
Japanese
and non-English language film to win the Best Visual Effects
category.[38][39] Director Hayao Miyazaki,
at the age of 83, became the oldest director to win Best Animated
Feature for The Boy and the
Heron.[40] Additionally, The Boy
and the Heron became the first PG-13
animated film to win Best Animated Feature;
all of the previous winners were rated G or
PG.[41]

Ceremony information


Jimmy Kimmel
hosted the 96th Academy Awards, his fourth overall.|alt=Photo of Jimmy
Kimmel in June 2022.

On October 17, 2023, Hamish
Hamilton was announced as
director.[55] On November 15, Jimmy Kimmel
was announced as host, returning for the second consecutive year and
fourth Academy Awards overall.[56] On November 30, 2023,
ABC and the Academy
announced that the start time of the ceremony would be moved up by an
hour to 4:00 p.m. PT (7:00 p.m. ET).[57] This change enabled ABC to air
a half-hour of primetime programming as a
lead-out,
featuring a new episode of its sitcom Abbott
Elementary.[58] An American Sign
Language livestream was broadcast on
the Academy's YouTube page featuring video of
interpreters.[59]
The pre-show was hosted for the
third consecutive year by Vanessa Hudgens,
joined by new co-host Julianne Hough.[60]
Due to the scheduling change, the pre-show was shortened to 30
minutes.[61] The beginning of the ceremony was delayed by six minutes,
due to arrivals being slowed by Israel–Hamas war
protests
outside of the theatre.[62][63][64]
On January 29, 2024, comedian and broadcaster Amelia
Dimoldenberg, host of the
YouTube interview series Chicken Shop
Date, was announced
as the social media ambassador and red
carpet correspondent. Dimoldenberg was involved
in multiple Oscar season events, including
the Oscars Nominees luncheon, where she participated in an Academy video
production with nominees. She was also involved interviewing people at
the Oscars red carpet and the "Oscars 96 Behind the Scenes Tour".[65]
Presenters were announced in a series of groups beginning on February
26, 2024.[66][67][68] Performers were announced on February 28,
2024.[69][70] After the first batch of presenters was announced, The
Hollywood Reporter learned that the
Academy would revive a popular presenting format previously used in
2009,[71] where five Oscar-winning
actors for leading and supporting performances took the stage together
to introduce the current nominees in their respective categories.[72]
David Alan Grier was selected as the
event's announcer.[73]
Production designers Alana Billingsley and Misty Buckley designed the
stage over the course of nine months. According to Billingsley and
Buckley, they were inspired by contemporary
spaces where people can "meet,
exchange, create [like] a modern-day
plaza".[74] Throughout the ceremony, the stage
subtly changed its design to honor the nominees; the screenplay
categories included images of real typewriters,
while the Best Costume
Design category
showcased images of several of the nominated costumes.[75]
Messi the Dog from Anatomy of a
Fall attended the ceremony and had his
own seat in the audience. According to The Hollywood
Reporter, multiple companies with
nominated films had complained to the Academy about him attending the
Oscar nominees luncheon and giving the film an advantage for voting.[76]
Before the ceremony, the show's host, Jimmy
Kimmel, shared a video in which he could be
seen rehearsing his Oscars jokes with Messi. He also made a surprise
appearance in the audience of the show and appeared to urinate on Matt
Damon's star on the Hollywood Walk of
Fame as part of the ongoing
Damon–Kimmel feud.[77]
Nominees Kaouther Ben Hania, Finneas
O'Connell, Billie
Eilish, and Mark
Ruffalo, as well as presenters Ramy
Youssef and Mahershala
Ali, wore red
Artists4Ceasefire badges calling for a
ceasefire in Gaza.[78][79][80][81]
Diversity rules
This was the first year that
diversity rules for the Best
Picture category became
mandatory. In June 2020, under its Academy Aperture
2025
initiative, the academy established a set of "representation and
inclusion standards" that a film would be required to satisfy in order
to compete in the category.[82] For the last two years, filmmakers were
just required to submit a confidential "Academy Inclusion Standards"
form for data purposes only.[83] There are four general standards, of
which a film must satisfy two to be considered for Best Picture: (a)
"on-screen representation, themes, and narratives"; (b) "creative
leadership and project team"; (c) "industry access and opportunities";
and (d) "audience development".[84]
As explained by Alissa Wilkinson of Vox in
2020, the standards "basically break down into two big buckets:
standards promoting more inclusive representation and standards
promoting more inclusive employment".[85] The standards are intended to
provide greater opportunities for employment for underrepresented racial
and ethnic groups, women, LGBTQ+ people, and persons
with
cognitive or
physical disabilities.[86]
Box office performance of Best Picture nominees
When the nominations were announced, the films nominated for Best
Picture had earned a combined gross of $1.09 billion at the American and
Canadian box offices at the time.[87] Barbie was the highest-grossing
film among the Best Picture nominees, with $636 million in domestic box
office receipts. Oppenheimer came in second with $327 million. The two
films, comprising the Barbenheimer phenomenon, represented 88% of the
cumulative box office haul generated by Best Picture nominees prior to
their nominations.[88] Oppenheimer became the highest-grossing Best
Picture winner since The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the
King at the
76th Academy Awards in 2004. It also
became the first one to gross more than $100 million at the domestic box
office in the decade since Argo at the
85th Academy Awards in 2013.[89]
Reception
The ceremony received mostly positive reviews from critics.[90] [91]
Highlights in reviews included the musical performances of "I'm Just
Ken" and "Wahzhazhe (A Song for My People)", John
Mulaney summarizing the plot of Field of
Dreams while presenting the award for
Best Sound, an almost nude
John Cena presenting Best Costume
Design (which Kimmel
billed as marking the 50th anniversary of a streaking incident at the
1974
ceremony),[92][93]
and past acting winners introducing this year's nominees.[94][95][96]
The Zone of Interest director Jonathan
Glazer received substantial praise and
criticism for his Best International
Feature
acceptance speech, during which he called for the end of Israel's
bombardment of
Gaza.[97]
One sentence from Glazer's speech, in which he said that he and fellow
producer James Wilson "stand here
as men who refute their Jewishness and the Holocaust being hijacked by
an occupation", was widely misinterpreted and misquoted, with some
sources ending the quote after the words "refute their Jewishness" and
incorrectly suggesting that Glazer was disavowing his Jewish
identity.[98][99][100] Many pro-Israel figures disapproved of the
statement,[101][102] and in the days following the ceremony, over 1,000
Jewish members of the film industry signed an open
letter denouncing Glazer's speech and defending
the actions of the Israeli government.[103][104] Others defended
Glazer's comments, including writer Tony
Kushner[105] and the director of the
Auschwitz-Birkenau State
Museum, where The Zone of
Interest is set and where parts of it were filmed.[106]
Conversely, the In Memoriam section received criticism for being too
distracting and the names and faces being so tiny and distant much of
the time that it was difficult recognizing them.[107][108][109] The Best
Picture presentation by Al Pacino was criticized
for not naming the 10 nominees before announcing the
winner.[110][111][112] Clips from the Best Picture nominees had been
shown over the course of the ceremony, and producer Molly McNearney said
to Variety that the reading of the
nominees was cut "because we were very worried that the show was going
to be long". Similarly, the nominees for Best Original Song were also
not read aloud when handed out by Cynthia
Erivo and Ariana
Grande, as each of the songs had been
performed earlier in the evening.[113] Acknowledging that it was not his
decision, Pacino later apologized for not listing the nominees, saying
that "to not be fully recognized is offensive and hurtful".[114]
Ratings
The American telecast on ABC drew in an average of 19.5 million people
over its length, which was a 4% increase from the previous year's
ceremony and marking the longest streak of annual ratings increases for
the Academy Awards since 2014.[115]
However, the show slipped a little among adults ages 18–49 with a 3.81
rating among viewers in that key
demographic, down 5% from 4.03 rating of
the previous year's ceremony.[116] The viewership peaked in the last
half-hour with 21.9 million total viewers.[117] The ceremony scored the
biggest audience for any awards show since the 92nd Academy
Awards in 2020, and is so far the
largest viewership for any live non-sports entertainment program on U.S.
television in the post–COVID-19 pandemic
era.[118] ABC's Abbott Elementary
lead-out also benefitted, with the episode reaching a series high in the
18–49 demo (1.42 rating) and total viewership (6.9 million).[119][120]
"In Memoriam"
